# Utilities for YouTube transcripts

This script is created from [Concatenate Transcript](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/402811-concatenate-transcript)
created by [Oliwang](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/302389-oliwang) and
[Youtube Transcript Snatcher](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/421864-youtube-transcript-snatcher)
created by [GSRHackZ](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/737702-gsrhackz), it is
thanks to them and some stackoverflow answers that it was possible to create,
so big shoutout to them!!

I joined the different configurations to make a single script with multiple
features (in process), but due to lack of time I had to do the code quickly and
that causes some features to not work correctly (in the future I will fix them)

To use this script you only need an administrator/extension that allows you to
use it automatically without having to type the code over and over again, I
personally use Tampermonkey (you can use any other, just copy and paste the code)
, it can be downloaded on its [official website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
or if you use Google Chrome you can [download the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
